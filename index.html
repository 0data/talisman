      Talisman is a tool is to validate code changes that are to be pushed out of a
      local Git repository on a developer's workstation. By hooking into the
      pre-push hook provided by Git, it validates the outgoing changeset for things
      that look suspicious - such as potential SSH keys, authorization tokens,
      private keys etc. The aim is for Talisman to scan both file names &amp; file
      content so that even potential problems embedded in source code and
      documentation can be caught.
