  Talisman is a tool is to validate code changes that are to be pushed out of a local Git repository on a developer's workstation. By hooking into the pre-push hook provided by Git, it validates the outgoing changeset for things that look suspicious - such as potential SSH keys, authorization tokens, private keys etc. The aim is for Talisman to scan both file names &amp; file content so that even potential problems embedded in source code and documentation can be caught.
